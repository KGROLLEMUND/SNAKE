Akatsuki has always been a group that has stood out from other teams by its choices, its performance, its personality and the individual quality of its members. Our DNA is what it is, you don't need a history lesson. It is up to the exceptional members to shine through their uniqueness. And we will shine so brightly that what we are about to accomplish will not be possible after our success. A world separates our organisation from others. We will do what we have always done, demonstrate that we are the best.

The team is composed of:

Our Game is Snake Game

# What is the snake game ?

A Snake Game is an action game that consists of a snake that is constantly moving inside a level. The player controls the direction of the snake, but the snake always keeps moving. When the snake eats something, it grows in size. If the snake touches the boundaries of the level, or if it tries to eat its own tail, the game is over. The goal of the game is to keep the snake alive as long as possible.
